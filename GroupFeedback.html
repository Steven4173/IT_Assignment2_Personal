<b>Jenny</b> <br>
She helped the group a lot with organisation especially when scheduling and rescheduling group meetings to reasonable time that suited everyone. She was very quick to be organised and invited the group to a Google Doc early into the assignment.  Often during group meetings she would help bring back the group to communicate after a silent period of working to see how we all progressed.  She did a great job with the Industry Data section by using Burning Glass.<br><br>

<b>Chamal</b> <br>
He displayed good leadership throughout the assignment. Especially during the early stages, he would set small deadlines for the group so that we were always progressing in our work. Through this he demonstrated good communication skills with the group. He moved us forward in using GitHub and always checked up each individual member whenever certain things were required. He always tries to make himself available and is incredibly helpful when asking for help.<br><br>

<b>Jeremy</b> <br>
He was often outspoken and direct when communicating ideas to the group. His suggestions were clear to understand, making it very easy to work with him.  His contributions were core to the website and assessment which in turn is highly appreciated. He always made sure that we were on track with our work as a group. For instance, filling in the agenda at the end of each meeting helped the group assess what has been accomplished and what still needed to be done. He would also sometimes add extra information to other people’s work as a helpful gesture.<br><br>

<b>Momitha </b> <br>
She communicated well with the lecturers. If we had a question as a group that we couldn’t answer for a while, she would often send an email to one of the lecturers to help bring clarity to a certain issue. She contributed significantly to the assignment work and communicated well with others during group meetings. <br><br><br><br><br>

<b>Steven</b> <br>
He has been constantly working well to communicate with the team whenever a problem has arised. Despite being busy with uni and working, he has displayed great initiative in completing tasks to stay up to date with the rest of the group, even if he is unable to attend a meeting. <br><br>

<b>Chamal</b> <br>
His leadership was of great use in our group as at first we were all very quiet. He would speak up in meetings to make sure we were on track and would explain to any one of us how something worked if we did not understand.   <br><br>

<b>Jeremy</b> <br>
His work within the group was done quite well, he brought in his mum, an IT professional, to come help us with our interviewing process. He worked on a lot of the technical side of our assignment in terms of putting together our website and helping us out where he could. His leadership was shown when he helped us get on track to putting together our website to make it look and function well. <br><br>

<b>Momitha </b> <br>
Although quiet in meetings, she produced great work in her writing. She worked well in writing up her research and helped out in any other areas she could to elaborate our descriptions. She communicated well with asking questions for our team whenever we were stuck on a particular section.

<b>Jenny</b> <br>
She organised our meetings and ensured everyone is on track throughout the group meetings. She has completed her task to a great level and communicated very well until the end of our assignment. She asked questions if she was unsure and got it clarified. She also recorded the responses for the interview.  <br><br>

<b>Chamal</b> <br>
He communicated effectively with all the group members in sorting our tasks to do and his leadership was shown in making certain that we are all on the same page. He has done good research in IT technologies and managed to ask everyone their opinions regarding the assignment.   <br><br>

<b>Jeremy</b> <br>
He contributed tremendously to our group in terms of designing of the website. He proofread some of the parts written by the rest of the group members to maintain the consistency. Also, he made it possible to interview an IT professional to get sense of what data engineers do. He communicated well with the group members and kept us on track in writing the agendas.  <br><br>

<b>Steven </b> <br>
He balanced his personal and work schedule well and contributed thoroughly in the assignment. He was keeping up-to-date in every meeting and showed responsibility in finishing his tasks to a high standard. He helped us write some parts where we were unsure and communicated quite with the group.  <br><br><br><br><br>
